    <section>
      <p>Cats have earned a reputation as gentle, independent, and low-maintenance companions. While both cats and dogs can make great pets, here are a few reasons some people might prefer cats over dogs.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Low Maintenance</h2>
      <p>Cats usually take care of themselves when it comes to grooming, and they generally adapt well to living in smaller spaces. They also do not need to be taken outside for regular walks, making them convenient for people with busy schedules or limited outdoor access.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Independence</h2>
      <p>Cats are known for their independent nature. They can spend hours entertaining themselves, whether by napping in a cozy spot or playing with a favorite toy. This independence can be appealing for individuals who are not always home or who appreciate a pet with a more laid-back demeanor.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Quiet Companionship</h2>
      <p>Cats are generally quieter than dogs, which means fewer noise disturbances. Most cats meow occasionally, but they are far less likely to bark or create loud noises. If you live in an apartment or have noise restrictions, a cat can be an ideal pet.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Easy Litter Training</h2>
      <p>Cats instinctively understand how to use a litter box, making house-training relatively straightforward. This saves owners time and effort in teaching proper bathroom habits.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Cozy Cuddlers</h2>
      <p>Despite their independent nature, many cats are affectionate with their human family. Their warm presence, soft fur, and gentle purring can be a comforting stress reliever after a long day.</p>
